# Depth-First-Search and Breadth-First-Search visualization

In this laboratory work, the visualization of depth-first and breadth-first search algorithms in a multigraph is implemented. Program:

+ Builds a sequence of graph vertices obtained using the breadth / depth search algorithm in the graph
+ Renders the resulting graph to the user
+ When requesting to draw, DFS or BFS saves the sequence of changes in the form of a sequence of pictures and gif-image
+ Gifs and pictures can also be displayed
